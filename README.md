# Olympic-Medal-Prediction-ML-Python

A simple machine learning model that predicts a team's medal count during the Olympic Games.

Using historical data from 1964 to 2016, the model uses the athlete count, event count, and previous medals count variables as predictors for team
medal counts, as these variables have strong correlations, ranging from 0.77 to 0.92. The model uses data from 1964-2008 for training, and data from
2012-2016 for testing.

This simple ML model provides fairly accurate predictions for teams that typically receive many medals, and less accurate predictions for teams that
do not receive many medals.
